# Capstone-2018
This is a shell repository for capstone projects that are co-sponsored by the Open Data Literacy project at the University of Washington's [iSchool](https://ischool.uw.edu/).

Directions:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Rename the repository to something meaningful.
3. Revise the `readme.md` to include a title and brief description of the project. Please also include the sponsor, all team members, and their role.
4. Use the `PlanOfWork.md` template to document your proposal. It is especially helpful to create milestones for your project.
5. As much as possible - keep this repository up to date. Add to this: data, software, and documentation you create in completing the project. At the end of the capstone you should upload your poster, and any final deliverables that you have created.
